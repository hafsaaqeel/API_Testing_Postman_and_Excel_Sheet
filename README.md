# API Testing with Postman and Excel

This repository is dedicated to showcasing the process of testing an API using Postman and documenting the test cases in Excel format. The primary goal of this project was to run a set of API calls in Postman to analyze and check the responses, followed by organizing and recording the test cases in an Excel sheet for easier tracking and reference.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find:

- The Postman collection that was used to test various API endpoints.
- An Excel file documenting the test cases, including input parameters, expected responses, and actual results.
- A description of the approach used for API testing and how it was recorded in Excel for further analysis.

## Project Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate a simple, manual approach to API testing using the Postman tool and tracking the results in an organized manner through Excel. This process helps in:

- Verifying the functionality of APIs.
- Testing edge cases and expected responses.

## Tools Used

- **Postman**: Used to send requests to the API and check responses.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used to record test cases and results in an organized format.

## Repository Structure

- `Books_API_Testing.postman_collection`: Contains the Postman collection file with all the API requests.
- `Books_API_Testing`: Contains the Excel file (`.xlsx`) that includes all the documented test cases.
  - Each row in the Excel sheet represents a test case, including details like the API endpoint, input data, expected response, and actual result.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
